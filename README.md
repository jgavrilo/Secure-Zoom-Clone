In one terminal go to the project directory and implement the following commands: <br />
npm i express ejs socket.io <br />
npm i uuid <br />
npm i --save-dev nodemon <br />

These three lines are our dependencies: <br />
Express is the server we are using <br />
Ejs as our templating language for our rooms <br />
Socket.io allows for communication with the server <br />
Uuid allows us to create our room url's<br />
Nodemon is our dev dependency which allows for us to refresh the server while we work on it<br />

Finally run the following command to run the server:<br />
npm run devStart<br />

In a second terminal go to the project directory and implement the following commands:<br />
code .<br />
npm install<br />
peerjs --port 3001<br />

This allows other users to joing the room and communicate with people in it<br />

The application can now be used through localhost:3000/
